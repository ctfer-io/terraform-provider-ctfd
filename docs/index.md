## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) User API key. Could use `CTFD_API_KEY` environment variable instead. Despite being the most convenient way to authenticate yourself, we do not recommend it as you will probably generate a long-live token without any rotation policy.
- `nonce` (String, Sensitive) User session nonce, comes with session. Could use `CTFD_NONCE` environment variable instead.
- `session` (String, Sensitive) User session token, comes with nonce. Could use `CTFD_SESSION` environment variable instead.
- `url` (String) CTFd base URL (e.g. `https://my-ctf.lan`). Could use `CTFD_URL` environment variable instead.
